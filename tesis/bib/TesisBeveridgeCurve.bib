abstract = {Existen diversas razones por las cuales los hacedores de pol{\'{i}}tica deben prestar atenci{\'{o}}n al tama{\~{n}}o, estruc-tura y evoluci{\'{o}}n del sector informal, aun m{\'{a}}s si en las {\'{u}}ltimas d{\'{e}}cadas este ha ido en aumento, tanto en los pa{\'{i}}ses en desarrollo como en los pa{\'{i}}ses desarrollados. La literatura econ{\'{o}}mica identifica hasta cuatro moti-vos: (1) Las actividades informales reducen la base impositiva, con lo cual impiden un financiamiento sostenible de bienes p{\'{u}}blicos y de protecci{\'{o}}n social. (2) Un sector informal pr{\'{o}}spero puede distorsionar las estad{\'{i}}sticas oficiales, raz{\'{o}}n por la cual las decisiones de pol{\'{i}}tica basadas en estos indicadores pueden ser poco efectivas o contrarias al objetivo deseado. Asimismo, (3) una econom{\'{i}}a paralela en auge puede atraer trabajadores y fomentar la competencia de-sigual con empresas formales. Por {\'{u}}ltimo, (4) el sector informal puede, contrariamente a lo establecido en (3), generar spillovers positivos sobre la econom{\'{i}}a porque siembra un esp{\'{i}}ritu empresarial y din{\'{a}}mico, aumenta la competencia y, por lo tanto, el nivel de eficiencia. Esta {\'{u}}ltima raz{\'{o}}n, si bien controvertida, tiene evidencia tanto a favor como en contra. Lo cierto es que pareciera existir cierto consenso respecto de la idea de que una elevada dimensi{\'{o}}n del sector infor-mal suele afectar, de manera negativa, la evoluci{\'{o}}n de la actividad econ{\'{o}}mica. De este modo, el objetivo de la presente investigaci{\'{o}}n consiste en aproximar el nivel de evasi{\'{o}}n (ingreso no reportado) de los individuos en el Per{\'{u}}, bajo un enfoque microeconom{\'{e}}trico de discrepancias en el consumo que se detalla m{\'{a}}s adelante. Aspectos conceptuales El primer aspecto conceptual a ser tratado es el problema de la definici{\'{o}}n del sector informal. Cual-quier estudio sobre informalidad debe definir qu{\'{e}} se entiende por sector informal, ya que en la literatura econ{\'{o}}mica no existe consenso al respecto. Podemos citar dos definiciones que han sido utilizadas con rela-tiva frecuencia: la primera, describe al sector informal como " toda actividad econ{\'{o}}mica que contribuye con el PBI observado o calculado de manera oficial, pero que no se encuentra registrada " 2 ; y la segunda, como " la producci{\'{o}}n en el mercado, legal o ilegal, de bienes y servicios que escapan al registro del PBI oficial " (Schneider y Enste 2000). Sin embargo, estas definiciones no son del todo completas. Otras definiciones enmarcan la econom{\'{i}}a informal dentro de un contexto m{\'{a}}s amplio, que incluye acti-vidades legales e ilegales y transacciones monetarias y no monetarias. De acuerdo con esta definici{\'{o}}n, adem{\'{a}}s de las actividades independientes del hogar, el ingreso no reportado en la producci{\'{o}}n de bienes y},

abstract = {This article develops a new econometric methodology for performing stochastic model specification search (SMSS) in the vast model space of time-varying parameter VARs with stochastic volatility and correlated state transitions. This is motivated by the concern of over-fitting and the typically imprecise inference in these highly parameterized models. For each VAR coefficient, this new method automatically decides whether it is constant or time-varying. Moreover, it can be used to shrink an otherwise unrestricted time-varying parameter VAR to a stationary VAR, thus providing an easy way to (probabilistically) impose stationarity in time-varying parameter models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a topical application, where we investigate the dynamic effects of structural shocks in government spending on U.S. taxes and GDP during a period of very low interest rates. },

abstract = {This paper considers the estimation of the variance of coefficients in time varying parameter models with stationary regressors.  The maximum likelihood estimator has large point mass at zero.  We therefore develop asymptotically median unbiased estimators and confidence intervals by inverting median functions of regression-based parameter stability test statistics, computed under the constant-parameter null.  These estimators have good asymptotic relative efficiencies for small to moderate amounts of parameter variability.  We apply these results to an unobserved components model of trend growth in postwar U.S.  GDP:  the MLE implies that there has been no change in the trend rate, while the upper range of the median-unbiased point estimates imply that the annual trend growth rate has fallen by 0.7 percentage points over the postwar period.},

abstract = {For a VAR with drifting coefficients and stochastic volatilities, we present posterior densities for several objects that are pertinent for designing and evaluating monetary policy. These include measures of inflation persistence, the natural rate of unemployment, a core rate of inflation, and 'activism coefficients' for monetary policy rules. Our posteriors imply substantial variation of all of these objects for post WWII US data. After adjusting for changes in volatility, persistence of inflation increases during the 1970s, then falls in the 1980s and 1990s. Innovation variances change systematically, being substantially larger in the late 1970s than during other times. Measures of uncertainty about core inflation and the degree of persistence covary positively. We use our posterior distributions to evaluate the power of several tests that have been used to test the null hypothesis of time-invariance of autoregressive coefficients of VARs against the alternative of time-varying coefficients. Except for one, we find that those tests have low power against the form of time variation captured by our model. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In a recent paper, Bai and Perron (1998) considered theoretical issues related to the limiting distribution of estimators and test statistics in the linear model with multiple structural changes. In this companion paper, we consider practical issues for the empirical applications of the procedures. We first address the problem of estimation of the break dates and present an efficient algorithm to obtain global minimizers of the sum of squared residuals. This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O(T2) for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks. Finally, a few empirical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures. All methods discussed are implemented in a GAUSS program.},

@article{Blanchard2000,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {One of the most striking aspect of the Great Recession in the United States is the persistently high level of unemployment despite an uptick in economic activity and an increased willingness by firms to hire. This has stimulated a debate on mismatch in the labor market. The argument is that despite the high unemployment rate the effective pool of job seekers is considerably smaller due to adverse effects of long-term unemployment, high unemployment benefits or structural change. Despite high vacancy postings, firms are therefore unable to hire desired workers. I study this issue from an aggregate perspective by deriving the Beveridge curve from a discrete-time search and matching model of the labor market driven by a variety of shocks. I first establish that the observed pattern in the data can only be described in the context of the model by the interaction of a cyclical decline in productivity and a decline in match efficiency. I then estimate the model using Bayesian methods on unemployment and vacancy data before the onset of the Great Recession. The posterior estimates indicate that the recent behavior of the Beveridge curve is most likely explained by a structural decline in match efficiency.},

abstract = {Recent labor market trends have raised concerns that the unemployment rate is high not because employers are reluctant to hire but because they are unable to hire. These concerns, if true, would cast doubt on using monetary policy to stimulate the labor market, since it works by encouraging firms to hire more. Using a matching function approach, the author finds that a shock that makes it more difficult for firms to hire qualified applicants would by itself imply an unemployment rate of no more than 7.1 percent, much below the actual unemployment rate during the past two years. Hence, the recent patterns in unemployment and vacancy data do not necessarily rule out a role for monetary policy.},

abstract = {Monetary policy and the private sector behavior of the US economy are modeled as a time varying structural vector autoregression, where the sources of time variation are both the coefficients and the variance covariance matrix of the innovations. The paper develops a new, simple modeling strategy for the law of motion of the variance covariance matrix and proposes an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the model likelihood/posterior numerical evaluation. The main empirical conclusions are: 1) both systematic and non-systematic monetary policy have changed during the last forty years. In particular, long run systematic responses of the interest rate to inflation and unemployment exhibit a trend toward a more aggressive behavior, despite remarkable oscillations; 2) this has had a negligible effect on the rest of the economy. The role played by exogenous non-policy shocks seems much more important than monetary policy in explaining the high inflation and unemployment episodes in recent US economic history.},

Some of the stylized facts of business cycles, with which the predictions of the model are consistent, include first, real wages do not fully reflect fluctuations in the real value of labor's marginal product, so real profits fluctuate more than real wages. Second, unemployment responds to output shocks, but its response is slow. Finally, in countries where there are good data on vacancies, like Britain, we observe that vacancies respond more quickly to shocks and with greater amplitude than unemployment.},

Movements along a fixed downward sloping Beveridge curve are associated with cyclical shocks, while shifts of the curve arise from structural factors that alter the matching efficiency between job vacancies and unemployed workers. National and regional data on job vacancies and unemployment are combined to estimate the Beveridge curves of five European countries and their regions, focusing on the period 1975 to 2004. I also analyse whether shifts in European Beveridge curves are due to changes in the composition of the unemployed pool, labour market rigidities or cyclical and structural shocks. The empirical evidence suggests that changes in labour market rigidities, long term unemployment, as well as cyclical shocks are responsible for outward shifts in European Beveridge curves. I also find evidence of nonlinearities in the relation between unemployment and labour market institutions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

The fully modified estimator of Phillips and Hansen is extended to cover general models with stochastic and deterministic trends, The test statistics considered include the SupF test of Quandt, as well as the LM tests of Nyblom and of Nabeya and Tanaka. It is found that the asymptotic distributions depend on the nature of the regressor processes-that is, if the regressors are stochastic or deterministic trends, The distributions are noticeably different from the distributions when the data are weakly dependent. It is also found that the lack of cointegration is a special case of the alternative hypothesis considered (an unstable intercept), so the tests proposed here may also be viewed as a test of the null of cointegration against the alternative of no cointegration. The tests are applied to three data sets-an aggregate consumption function, a present value model of stock prices and dividends, and the term structure of interest rates.},

The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance terms, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than the main analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system. Additions to this second edition include the filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian series. Part I of the book obtains the mean and variance of the state, of a variable intended to measure the effect of an interaction and of regression coefficients, in terms of the observations. Part II extends the treatment to nonlinear and non-normal models. For these, analytical solutions are not available so methods are based on simulation.},

Warren claims that a disequilibrium approach to the problem reveals that there is no equilibrium relationship, making the discussion of shifts irrelevant.

abstract = {Important progress has been made in economists' understanding of the Beveridge curve, from its measurement to its expression in canonical labor market models. Yet enduring puzzles remain. Chief among these are the empirical role of vacancies in the recruitment process; the amplitude, comovement, and persistence of cyclical unemployment–vacancy dynamics; and the sources of lateral shifts in the Beveridge curve. The synthesis of these themes identifies several priorities for ongoing research, including the role of entry costs into vacancy creation in shaping Beveridge dynamics; the cyclicality of search intensity, both off and on the job, and its relation to participation and job-to-job transitions; the theory and measurement of mismatch; and the sources of hysteresis in unemployment flows},

Our approach simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously generates all the indicator variables conditional on the state vectors. The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a time. The empirical results suggest that our approach is both practical to implement and dominates the Gibbs sampler that generates the states one at a time. {\textcopyright} 1994 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract = {The theoretical Beveridge curve has a negative slope and is convex to the origin, a relationship most often associated to the short run. However, search and matching theory indicates that certain shocks may affect unemployment and vacancies in the same way. I trace the effects of both types of shocks affecting the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate using U.S. data. I impose common factor restrictions in an unobserved component model and sign restrictions in a vector autoregressive model. I derive negatively and positively-correlated components of vacancies and unemployment. The negatively-sloped Beveridge curve is the result of an aggregate labour demand shock. This shock also causes some more long-lasting effects for vacancies and unemployment, the ‘loops' around the Beveridge curve. The shock that creates a positive co-movement between vacancies and unemployment is due to matching efficiency and job destruction. This positive co-movement occurs after recessions and in the long run.},

In that respect, as shown in simulation exercises in the paper, the incorporation of stochastic volatility to the TVP estimation significantly improves estimation performance. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for the estimation of the TVP-VAR models with stochastic volatility. As an example of empirical application, the TVP-VAR model with stochastic volatility is estimated using the Japanese data with significant structural changes in dynamic relationship between the macroeconomic variables.},

The adjustment procedure suggests that because measurement errors give rise to spurious transitions between labor market states, the labor market may be less dynamic than previously thought. The results imply that conventional measures may understate the duration of unemployment by as much as eighty per cent, and overstate the frequency of labor force entry and exit by even more.},

These classes are tests based on maximum likelihood scores (including the Nyblom-Hansen test), on F statistics (sup F , ave F , exp F tests), and on OLS residuals (OLS-based CUSUM and MOSUM tests). We show that (representatives from) these classes are special cases of the generalized M -fluctuation tests, based on the same functional central limit theorem but employing different functionals for capturing excessive fluctuations. After embedding these tests into the same framework and thus understanding the relationship between these procedures for testing in historical samples, it is shown how the tests can also be extended to a monitoring situation. This is achieved by establishing a general M -fluctuation monitoring procedure and then applying the different functionals corresponding to monitoring with ML scores, F statistics, and OLS residuals. In particular, an extension of the sup F test to a monitoring scenario is suggested and illustrated on a real-world data set.},

The incorporation of wage stickiness vastly increases the sensitivity of the model to driving forces. I develop a new model of the way that wage stickiness affects unemployment. The stickiness arises in an economic equilibrium and satisfies the condition that no worker-employer pair has an unexploited opportunity for mutual improvement. Sticky wages neither interfere with the efficient formation of employment matches nor cause inefficient job loss. Thus the model provides an answer to the fundamental criticism previously directed at sticky-wage models of fluctuations.},

To illustrate this, we show that the solution proposed in Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) is rather fragile and fails for some countries in our sample.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that direct repression of their mRNA targets. The miRNA "seed"-nucleotides 2-7-establishes target specificity by mediating target binding. Accurate processing of the miRNA 5' end is thought to be under strong selective pressure because a shift by just one nucleotide in the 5' end of a miRNA alters its seed sequence, redefining its repertoire of targets (Figure 1). Animal miRNAs are produced by the sequential cleavage of partially double-stranded precursors by the RNase III endonucleases Drosha and Dicer, thereby generating a transitory double-stranded intermediate comprising the miRNA paired to its partially complementary miRNA* strand. Here, we report that in flies, the 5' ends of miRNAs and miRNA* strands are typically more precisely defined than their 3' ends. Surprisingly, the precision of the 5' ends of both miRNA and miRNA* sequences increases after Argonaute2 (Ago2) loading. Our data imply that either many miRNA* sequences are under evolutionary pressure to maintain their seed sequences-that is, they have targets-or that secondary constraints, such as the sequence requirements for loading small RNAs into functional Argonaute complexes, narrow the range of miRNA and miRNA 5' ends that accumulate in flies},

Our approach is nonparametric with respect to nuisance parameters and thereby allows for a very wide class of weakly dependent and possibly heterogeneously distributed data. The tests accommodate models with a fitted drift and a time trend so that they may be used to discriminate between unit root nonstationarity and stationarity about a deterministic trend. The limiting distributions of the statistics are obtained under both the unit root null and a sequence of local alternatives. The latter noncentral distribution theory yields local asymptotic power functions for the tests and facilitates comparisons with alternative procedures due to Dickey {\&} Fuller. Simulations are reported on the performance of the new tests in finite samples. {\textcopyright} 1988 Biometrika Trust.},

@article{Engle1982,
abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autore-gressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

abstract = {Availability for work and engagement in active job search have been the conventional criteria to distinguish the unemployed from those not in the labor force. In this paper we use the American Time Use Survey 2003–2017 to compare the demographic characteristics, time allocation and transition rates to employment between the unemployed and three subgroups of those not in the labor force — the retired, the disabled, and those not in the labor force but not retired or disabled (the nonretired and nondisabled OLF). We find that although those not in the labor force share the common feature of no time spent on job search, their demographics, time allocation and transition rates to employment expose a drastic divide between the retired or disabled and the rest of nonworkers out of the labor force. Despite differences in time spent on job search, non-retired and non-disabled OLF males share similar demographic characteristics and time allocation patterns as unemployed males and have similar transition rates to employment. By contrast, non-retired and non-disabled OLF females who are married or have children or both show high opportunity costs of substituting search and market activities for child care and nonmarket work. We argue that the conventional job search criterion masks significant heterogeneities within those not in the labor force. We advocate additional alternative measures of labor underutilization that include nonretired and nondisabled OLF males and a subset of nonretired and nondisabled OLF females who are single and without children.},

abstract = {Recent work has suggested the possibility that the Beveridge curve can shift over the business cycle. This is in contrast with a large body of literature claiming that Beveridge curves have shifted due to structural changes alone. To test these claims, we use county-level data to estimate the timing and magnitude of shifts in aggregate and regional British Beveridge curves. We find that these shifts coincide with the business cycle rather than with hysteresis effects or with changes in regional mismatch. This implies that the Beveridge curve is a flawed device for separating the effects of structural changes from those of the business cycle.},

The series is expressed as the sum of deterministic trend, random walk, and stationary error, and the test is the LM test of the hypothesis that the random walk has zero variance. The asymptotic distribution of the statistic is derived under the null and under the alternative that the series is difference-stationary. Finite sample size and power are considered in a Monte Carlo experiment. The test is applied to the Nelson-Plosser data, and for many of these series the hypothesis of trend stationarity cannot be rejected. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{Daly2012,
abstract = {The U.S. unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high since the 2007-2009 recession, leading some observers to conclude that structural rather than cyclical factors are to blame. Relying on a standard job search and matching framework and empirical evidence from a wide array of labor market indicators, we examine whether the natural rate of unemployment has increased since the recession began, and if so, whether the underlying causes are transitory or persistent. Our preferred estimate indicates an increase in the natural rate of unemployment of about one percentage point during the recession and its immediate aftermath, putting the current natural rate at around 6 percent. An assessment of the underlying factors responsible for this increase, including labor market mismatch, extended unemployment benefits, and uncertainty about overall economic conditions, implies that only a small fraction is likely to be persistent.},
