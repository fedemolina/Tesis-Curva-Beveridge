abstract = {Since 2013, the Uruguayan educational system has been using an online adaptive learning tool for mathematics: The Mathematics Adaptive Platform (PAM for its Spanish acronym). PAM's content has been adapted to the national curriculum and it is a tool that - based on an analysis of students' experiences - offers personalised feedback according to each student's skill level. The use of PAM has been spreading throughout the education system. By 2016, approximately half of all students in 3rd through 6th grades of primary education had used the platform. The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of the use of PAM on the test score gain in mathematics based on longitudinal data from a sample of students in primary education. The results show a positive effect of 0.2 standard deviations on mathematics test scores. Results also show that the impact of PAM increases as the socioeconomic status of students decreases. There is no heterogeneous impact by gender. This is the first evidence at a country-wide level of the impact of a pedagogical tool of this type.},

abstract = {To successfully reduce student attrition, it is imperative to understand what the underlying determinants of attrition are and which students are at risk of dropping out. We develop an early detection system (EDS) using administrative student data from a state and private university to predict student dropout as a basis for a targeted intervention. To create an EDS that can be used in any German university, we use the AdaBoost Algorithm to combine regression analysis, neural networks, and decision trees-instead of relying on only one specific method. Prediction accuracy at the end of the first semester is 79{\%} for the state university and 85{\%} for the private university of applied sciences. After the fourth semester, the accuracy improves to 90{\%} for the state university and 95{\%} for the private university of applied sciences.},

abstract = {This study examines the effects of interactive and learning structures enabled by different Learning Management Systems (LMS) on satisfaction and learner engagement in online courses. An LMS can support or hinder active engagement, meaningful connections between segments of the course, easy communication, and formative feedback by making it easier or more difficult for faculty to communicate course requirements, provide open-ended feedback, and place course elements that are used together contiguous to one another. This study compares sections of the same course, offered by the same instructors using the same course materials in at least two different LMSs. It examines whether the LMS in which the course is taught affects faculty and student communication behaviors, satisfaction, and social presence, teaching presence and cognitive presence as measured by the Community of Inquiry (COI) survey. Approximately twelve courses, taught in four different schools at DePaul University, will be studied. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {—This paper analyzes a national technology and education program in Uruguay known as Plan Ceibal. This work studies a sample of over 105,000 students from 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of public primary education in that country. This work aims to assess the impact of technology on teaching and learning of English. The method adopted is based on log-file data to compare two different modalities of English teaching (a face-to-face and a blended model). Additionally, we explored the correlation between a common measure of online engagement when using the Learning Management System (LMS) and an adaptive English assessment. We examined the impact of the teaching modalities on the students engagement and to what extent the engagement can contribute to enhance the student learning of English. This work documents the steps followed to elaborate the common measure of engagement to ensure transparency and its replicability (or improvement). A strength of this work, in comparison with previous studies, is the number of cases analyzed as well as the age of the target population (primary school students). The results indicate that engagement is affected by at least three key factors: socio-cultural context, teaching modality, and the role that teachers play. In fact, the higher the engagement level, the larger the proportion of students who achieve a better learning outcome in the assessment. This study shows that the use of LMS enhanced the learning experience when this tool is integrated within the ecosystem of the teaching and learning process. The findings of this study are consistent with previous works in the field, for instance: the relevance of the context as well as the role of teaching. Although the measurement of engagement can help to understand students performance noteworthy that as a stand-alone dimension it is a poor predictor of performance. To consider additional factors associated with learning is still necessary.},

abstract = {The present review examines research on the effects of educational technology applications on mathematics achievement in K-12 classrooms. Unlike previous reviews, this review applies consistent inclusion standards to focus on studies that met high methodological standards. In addition, methodological and substantive features of the studies are investigated to examine the relationship between educational technology applications and study features. A total of 74 qualified studies were included in our final analysis with a total sample size of 56,886 K-12 students: 45 elementary studies (N=31,555) and 29 secondary studies (N=25,331). Consistent with the more recent reviews, the findings suggest that educational technology applications generally produced a positive, though modest, effect (ES = +0.15) in comparison to traditional methods. However, the effects may vary by educational technology type. Among the three types of educational technology applications, supplemental CAI had the largest effect with an effect size of +0.18. The other two interventions, computer-management learning and comprehensive programs, had a much smaller effect size, +0.08 and +0.07, respectively. Differential impacts by various study and methodological features are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This work provides an overview of an education and technology monitoring system developed at Plan Ceibal, a nationwide initiative created to enable technology enhanced learning in Uruguay. Plan Ceibal currently offers one-to-one access to technology and connectivity to every student and teacher (from primary and secondary education) as well as a comprehensive set of educational software platforms. All these resources generate massive amounts of data about the progress and style of students learning. This work introduces the conceptual framework, design and preliminary results of the Big Data Center for learning analytics currently being developed at Plan Ceibal. This initiative is focused on exploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 degrees profile will be built including information characterizing the user's online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies.},
